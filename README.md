## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:
Iâ€™m passionate about data analysis and how it can be used to solve complex challenges in areas such as sustainability and solar energy. I strongly believe that tools like Python, SQL, and data science techniques can drive more informed decision-making in the environmental and energy sectors.

Iâ€™m always looking to stay current at the intersection of technology, sustainability, and renewable energy. I recently completed a Data Analytics bootcamp with TripleTen, where I applied my skills in hands-on projects, strengthening my abilities in data visualization, databases, and applied statistics.
